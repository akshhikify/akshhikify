## Frequency distribution: for example: dataset=rose, lilly, sunflower, rose, lilly, sunflower, rose, lilly, lilly
##  flower      frequency
#   rose        3
#   lilly       4
#   sunflower   5
# from this frequency table we derive bar graphd, pi charts
# we have cumulative frequency
##  flower      frequency       cumulative frequency
#   rose        3               3
#   lilly       4               7
#   sunflower   2               9
# 1.Bar graphs 2.Histograms
# 2.Histograms : pdf=smoothing if histogram and it is used for continuous
# 1.Bar graphs: used for discrete


# arithmetic mean for population and sample:
#         population(N)                            sample(n)
#      X={1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6}
#      mean=sumation i=1 to N into Xi/N           X=sumation i=1 to N into xi/N
# central tendency: 1.mean  2.meadian  3.mode
#     refers to the measure used to determine the centre of the distribution of data.
